    <h1>Bear Attack</h1>
    <p>
        There is a chance — depending on where you are — that you might come across a creature (say,
a grizzly bear) that could, if provoked, cause you serious bodily harm or even kill you. Sure, a
bear attack isn’t exactly a prevalent occurrence, but it does happen from time to time. Though
there are a number of factors that lead to such events, Mother Nature Network points out that the
increased number of human-bear conflicts can be linked to environmental degradation, such as
habitat loss, increasing populations, food shortages, and climate change. The best way for you to
survive a bear attack, of course, is to avoid one entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        When exploring, take extra steps to guard your food — such as by hanging a bear bag to avoid
curious animals — and carry a bear deterrent with you, such as bear spray. Also, protect yourself
when in your most vulnerable states (like when you are pooping in the woods).
    </p>
    <p>
        Nonetheless, in the event that you are forced into an encounter with a bear, you’ll want to be
prepared. Here is a rundown on how to survive a bear attack — including specific tips for grizzly
bears, black bears, and polar bears.
    </p>
    <h2>Brown Bears</h2>

    <p>
        Brown bears are the most widespread species of bears in the world in terms of continental reach.
They are also typically bigger and more aggressive than black bears, meaning a date with a brown
bear is one you will absolutely want to be prepared for
    </p>
    <p>
        Most bear attacks occur during grizzly-human interactions and usually involve a mother bear
protecting her cubs. Though food conditioning and surprise can also startle a brown bear into
aggressiveness, they are notorious for being fierce protectors. Brown bear attacks tend to be at
their highest between the months of May and June, when mothers are raising their young after a
long hibernation.

    <p style="color:red;">Here is what to do if you come in contact with a brown bear:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use bear pepper spray:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Experts recommend that hikers in a bear country bring along bear
                pepper spray — and have it handy. UDAP bear pepper spray is a highly concentrated spray that
                can stop a bear in its tracks better than a gun. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Do not run:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I repeat — if you meet a grizzly bear,
make sure to stand your ground, stay calm, and slowly reach for your bear spray (here’s how to
use pepper spray). The last thing you want to do is run because the bear will catch you. If he or
she stands tall in curiosity, move away slowly with your spray in your hand. If the bear continues
to follow you, continue to stand your ground and use your spray if necessary. (The best distance
to spray at an attacking bear is 40-50 ft.) 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Tuck and cover:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the bear starts to charge, it is best
to fall down into a fetal position while protecting your head, neck, and stomach. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Play dead:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the brown bear continues to charge at you, play dead. Grizzlies attack when they feel surprised or
threatened, so they tend to stop attacking when there is no longer a threat. However, don’t just get
up and run away once the bear leaves. Brown bears are ferocious beasts that won’t quit until
they are 100 percent sure that threat is gone 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
